### Please download landmarks data using this link (it's big)
### http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

### when you finish downloading, create a folder called "data", put .dat file in it

### Note that the first line says import dlib, so runing the code requires installing dlib, which is complicated asf. 
### You can try pip install dlib, doesn't work for me. I installed it manully using wheel file.
### You also need to install Cuda and Cudnn
